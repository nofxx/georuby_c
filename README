= This is geo, a 2D geometry library for ruby.

It provides fast operations for points, lines, triangles, intersections and containers.

== License:

This library is provided under the GPL-2.

== Dependencies:
glib:: http://www.gtk.org/

== Classes:
Geo::Point:: A 2D point providing some common geometry operations.
Geo::Line:: A 2D line consisting of 2 Geo::Points providing some common geometry operations.
Geo::Triangle:: A 2D triangle consisting of 3 Geo::Points providing some common geometry operations.
Geo::PointSet:: A Set-like container of Points.
Geo::LineSet:: A Set-like container of Lines that provides optimized versions of some common geometry operations on lines.
Geo::TriangleSet:: A Set-like container of Triangles that provides optimized versions of some common geometry operations on lines.

== Usage:

To use geo just install the gem.

== Examples:

To find if a given line intersects a set of 100 000 other lines:

 :include:examples/intersects.rb
